# Prototype 0

Test change to show pull request process to Neil.

This is the initial prototype developed as a strawman to test our assumptions around what is required for building a SP that meets RP needs.

Prototype 0 will be implemented as a Java application providing a minimal JSON interface without real SAML. It will simulate the ability to generate SAML AuthnRequests to Verify and process SAML Responses from Verify.

The `docs/adr` directory provides details on our current architectural decisions that we will test.

The `docs/diagrams` directory provides details diagrams describing:
* the suggested request flow
* the suggested response flow
* a service/component architecture

## Running the code

There are four projects you need to build, and three that you need to run.

### passport-verify

This is a node library used to communicate with the verify-service-provider.

```
cd passport-verify
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Compile the code and run the tests
./pre-commit.sh
# Prepare a symlink for easier development
yarn link
```

### stub-rp

```
cd stub-rp
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Create a symlink for easier development
yarn link passport-verify
# Compile the code and run the tests
./pre-commit.sh
# Start the application
./startup.sh
```

### verify-service-provider

```
cd verify-service-provider
./startup.sh
```

### stub-verify-hub

```
cd stub-verify-hub
./startup.sh
```

### Using the applications

Go to http://localhost:3200/verify/start
